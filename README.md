# VoiceCommands
Implementing an algorithm and building a ML model to recognize easy voice commands

# Goal
The model should be able to recognize voice commands such as ```up```, ```down```, ```left```, ```right```, ```yes```, ```no```, ```stop```, ```go```, ```on```, ```off```.  
All other words should be recognized as unknown or non trigger words, background noise or plain silence.

# DATASET
The dataset includes 105000 words of half a second, composed of 30 different short words, pronounced by thousands of persons.
